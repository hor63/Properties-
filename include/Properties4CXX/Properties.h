/** \brief Properties reader. Inspired from Java Properties
 *
 * Properties reader. This class implements a properties reader which is enhanced to the very bare-bones Java
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html" >Properties</a> class.
 * Enhancements are typed properties (Numeric, boolean), quoted (verbatim) strings, lists of values (strings only, quoted or un-quoted)
 * and structures
 *
 * The properties file
 * ===================
 *
 * Basically a properties file looks like
 *
 *     # This is a comment line. Comment and empty lines are ignored.
 *
 *     # Basic form: A key (here 'Property1') has a string value (here 'value1). Space and tab characters are eliminated
 *     # Each key-value pair is written in one line. Separator between key and value is the '=' character.
 *     Property1 = value1
 *
 *     # Verbatim String
 *     Property2 = " This is a String
 *                    which can span across multiple lines, and can have trailing or leading spaces
 *                    The double quotes character is masked by \". "
 *
 *     # Numeric values:
 *     # Integer decimal values
 *     Property3 = -123456
 *
 *     # Integer hexadecimal values (positive values only)
 *     Property4 = 0x12aDf4
 *     Property5 = 0X12aDf4
 *
 *     # Integer octal values (positive values only)
 *     Property6 = 0123456701234
 *
 *     # Integer decimal values
 *     Property7 = 123456
 *
 *     # double float values
 *     Property8  = -1234.678
 *     Property9  = -1234.678E-12
 *     Property10 = .2343e+.2
 *
 *     # Boolean values can be yes, no, true, false, on, off. Case insensitive.
 *     PropTrue1 = True
 *     PropTrue1 = False
 *     PropTrue1 = TRUE
 *     PropTrue1 = Yes
 *     PropTrue1 = no
 *     PropTrue1 = YES
 *     PropTrue1 = On
 *     PropTrue1 = off
 *     PropTrue1 = ON
 *
 *     # Lists of values
 *     Property11 = value1," VPROPERTIES4CXX_PUBLICalue 2 ", sddsds

 *     # Structures
 *     Property12 = {
 *       Property13 = sadfsd
 *       Property14 = 0x22AF
 *       PropList = sd , sd,sd,dds,s
 *       PropStruct = {
 *         PropA = sadfas
 *         # Keys must be unique within one structure level. Therefore key Property12 on this valid on this level
 *         Property12 = Valsdds
 *       }
 *
 *
 *     # UTF-8 keys and values are valid
 *     UmlautüßPr3s15 = Übermenschlich
 *
 *     # All special characters except blank, tab, ',', '{', '}, and '"' are valid for keys and values
 *     Pro.per<;ty16 = |vls<>@!#$%^&
 *
 * Properties of the properties file (pun intended)
 * -------------------
 *
 * Property keys are case sensitive.
 *
 * Property keys must be defined only once. Double definitions lead to an exception.
 *
 * Keys within one structure must be unique within the structure only.
 *
 * All values can be retrieved as strings, even the typed ones.
 *
 * Quoted strings
 * -------------------
 *
 * A quoted string can contain any character (including any UTF-8 character)
 *
 * A few selected special characters can be written as escaped characters.
 * The writing is the same as C/C++.
 *
 * - \\"	double quote	byte 0x22 in ASCII encoding
 * - \\\\	backslash	byte 0x5c in ASCII encoding
 * - \\f	form feed - new page	byte 0x0c in ASCII encoding
 * - \\n	line feed - new line	byte 0x0a in ASCII encoding
 * - \\r	carriage return	byte 0x0d in ASCII encoding
 * - \\t	horizontal tab	byte 0x09 in ASCII encoding
 * - \\v	vertical tab	byte 0x0b in ASCII encoding
 *
 * Any other escaped character is taken over literally. A sequence "\\x" will become "x". The '\\' character is swallowed.
 *
 * Numeric locale
 * -------------------
 *
 * The locale is always "C", i.e. the decimal separator is always the dot '.'. Hundred separators are not allowed.
 *
 * Thus a number in German locale 123,456 is not valid. Neither is a number 123,456.2323 valid input.
